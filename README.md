# Caps Block

## Overview

Provides the ability in Windows to help force the Caps Lock key in a toggled
off state while still allowing programs to use the key.

This application was created with the goal of supporting the Caps Lock key
as a voice key for various voice-supporting applications. Users can use the
key to trigger a voice event, but also reduce the chance that the Caps Lock
key is left enabled.
